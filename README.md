No builtin module in ES5. Community introduced custom module mechanism using plain js: Common Js in nodejs, AMD in browser.

In ES6, Module is a built-in feature. It gets support in both browser and nodejs.

Demo:
- [x] Publish Common Js module to npm
- [x] Use Common Js module in browser with Browserify support
- [x] Use ES6 Module in browser.
